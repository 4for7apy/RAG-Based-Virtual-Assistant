# RAG-BASED-VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot capable of providing information and answering queries related to the Infosys website. The chatbot utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from various pages of the Infosys website and stores it in a vector database for efficient retrieval. Additionally, it leverages OpenAI for natural language processing to enhance its conversational abilities.

### About Infosys Chatbot!

Infosys Chatbot is a comprehensive solution that integrates web scraping, vector database management, and user interface development to streamline data retrieval and enhance query capabilities. In this project, we leverage the power of web scraping to gather data from multiple pages on Infosys, a leading IT services company.

The scraped data is then organized and stored efficiently in a Qdrant vector database, enabling fast and scalable retrieval. To enhance the querying process, we utilize the ChatGPT API key, leveraging advanced natural language processing capabilities for more nuanced and accurate searches.

One of the key features of Chatbot is its intuitive user interface developed using Streamlit. This UI provides users with a seamless experience, allowing them to interact with the data effortlessly. By connecting the vector database with the Streamlit UI, we ensure that users can access the information they need quickly and effectively.

After rigorous development and testing, we are proud to announce that chatbot is now fully operational and successfully serving its intended purpose.
