# RAG-BASED-VIRTUAL-ASSISTANT

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a Virtual Assistant capable of providing information and answering queries related to the RAG website. The Virtual Assistant utilizes web scraping techniques to extract data from various pages of the RAG website and stores it in a vector database for efficient retrieval. Additionally, it leverages OpenAI for natural language processing to enhance its conversational abilities.

### About RAG Virtual Assistant!

RAG Virtual Assistant is a comprehensive solution that integrates web scraping, vector database management, and user interface development to streamline data retrieval and enhance query capabilities. In this project, we leverage the power of web scraping to gather data from multiple pages on RAG, a leading IT services company.

The scraped data is then organized and stored efficiently in a Qdrant vector database, enabling fast and scalable retrieval. To enhance the querying process, we utilize the ChatGPT API key, leveraging advanced natural language processing capabilities for more nuanced and accurate searches.

One of the key features of Virtual Assistant is its intuitive user interface developed using Streamlit. This UI provides users with a seamless experience, allowing them to interact with the data effortlessly. By connecting the vector database with the Streamlit UI, we ensure that users can access the information they need quickly and effectively.

After rigorous development and testing, we are proud to announce that Virtual Assistant is now fully operational and successfully serving its intended purpose.
